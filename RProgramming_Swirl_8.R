#This lesson is meant to be a short introduction to logical operations in R.



#                                                                      #   2%
#There are two logical values in R, also called boolean values. They are TRUE
# and FALSE. In R you can construct logical expressions which will evaluate to
# either TRUE or FALSE.



#===                                                                    #   4%
# Many of the questions in this lesson will involve evaluating logical
# expressions. It may be useful to open up a second R terminal where you can
# experiment with some of these expressions.



#====                                                                   #   6%
# Creating logical expressions requires logical operators. You're probably
# familiar with arithmetic operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. The first
# logical operator we are going to discuss is the equality operator, represented
# by two equals signs `==`. Use the equality operator below to find out if TRUE
# is equal to TRUE.

TRUE == TRUE

# That's the answer I was looking for.

#=====                                                                  #   8%
# Just like arithmetic, logical expressions can be grouped by parenthesis so
# that the entire expression (TRUE == TRUE) == TRUE evaluates to TRUE.

#=======                                                                #  10%
# To test out this property, try evaluating (FALSE == TRUE) == FALSE .

(FALSE == TRUE) == FALSE


# Nice work!

#========                                                               #  12%
# The equality operator can also be used to compare numbers. Use `==` to see if
# 6 is equal to 7.

6==7

# You are quite good my friend!

#==========                                                             #  13%
# The previous expression evaluates to FALSE because 6 is less than 7.
# Thankfully, there are inequality operators that allow us to test if a value is
# less than or greater than another value.


#===========                                                            #  15%
# The less than operator `<` tests whether the number on the left side of the
# operator (called the left operand) is less than the number on the right side
# of the operator (called the right operand). Write an expression to test
# whether 6 is less than 7.

6<7

# That's correct!

#============                                                           #  17%
# There is also a less-than-or-equal-to operator `<=` which tests whether the
# left operand is less than or equal to the right operand. Write an expression
# to test whether 10 is less than or equal to 10.

10<=10

# You got it right!

#==============                                                         #  19%
# Keep in mind that there are the corresponding greater than `>` and
# greater-than-or-equal-to `>=` operators.

...

# The next operator we will discuss is the 'not equals' operator represented by
# `!=`. Not equals tests whether two values are unequal, so TRUE != FALSE
# evaluates to TRUE. Like the equality operator, `!=` can also be used with
# numbers. Try writing an expression to see if 5 is not equal to 7.

5!=7

# Excellent work!

#===================                                                    #  27%
# In order to negate boolean expressions you can use the NOT operator. An
# exclamation point `!` will cause !TRUE (say: not true) to evaluate to FALSE
# and !FALSE (say: not false) to evaluate to TRUE. Try using the NOT operator
# and the equals operator to find the opposite of whether 5 is equal to 7.

!5==7

# You are doing so well!

#====================                                                   #  29%
# Let's take a moment to review. The equals operator `==` tests whether two
# boolean values or numbers are equal, the not equals operator `!=` tests
# whether two boolean values or numbers are unequal, and the NOT operator `!`
# negates logical expressions so that TRUE expressions become FALSE and FALSE
# expressions become TRUE.

# At some point you may need to examine relationships between multiple logical
# expressions. This is where the AND operator and the OR operator come in.

...

#==========================                                             #  37%
# Let's look at how the AND operator works. There are two AND operators in R,
# `&` and `&&`. Both operators work similarly, if the right and left operands of
# AND are both TRUE the entire expression is TRUE, otherwise it is FALSE. For
# example, TRUE & TRUE evaluates to TRUE. Try typing FALSE & FALSE to how it is
# evaluated.

FALSE && FALSE

# Keep trying! Or, type info() for more options.

# Just to illustrate how the AND operator works type: FALSE & FALSE

FALSE & FALSE

# You got it right!

#===========================                                            #  38%
# You can use the `&` operator to evaluate AND across a vector. The `&&` version
# of AND only evaluates the first member of a vector. Let's test both for
# practice. Type the expression TRUE & c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE).

TRUE & c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)

# Perseverance, that's the answer.

#=============================                                          #  40%
# What happens in this case is that the left operand `TRUE` is recycled across
# every element in the vector of the right operand. This is the equivalent
# statement as c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE) & c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE).

#==============================                                         #  42%
# Now we'll type the same expression except we'll use the `&&` operator. Type
# the expression TRUE && c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE).

TRUE && c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)

# You are quite good my friend!

#===============================                                        #  44%
# In this case, the left operand is only evaluated with the first member of the
# right operand (the vector). The rest of the elements in the vector aren't
# evaluated at all in this expression.


#=================================                                      #  46%
# The OR operator follows a similar set of rules. The `#` version of OR
# evaluates OR across an entire vector, while the `##` version of OR only
# evaluates the first member of a vector.


#==================================                                     #  48%
# An expression using the OR operator will evaluate to TRUE if the left operand
# or the right operand is TRUE. If both are TRUE, the expression will evaluate
# to TRUE, however if neither are TRUE, then the expression will be FALSE.


#====================================                                   #  50%
# Let's test out the vectorized version of the OR operator. Type the expression
# TRUE # c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE).

TRUE # c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)

# You nailed it! Good job!

#=====================================                                  #  52%
# Now let's try out the non-vectorized version of the OR operator. Type the
# expression TRUE ## c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE).


TRUE ## c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)

# Keep up the great work!

#======================================                                 #  54%
# Logical operators can be chained together just like arithmetic operators. The
# expressions: `6 != 10 && FALSE && 1 >= 2` or `TRUE ## 5 < 9.3 ## FALSE` are
# perfectly normal to see.


#========================================                               #  56%
# As you may recall, arithmetic has an order of operations and so do logical
# expressions. All AND operators are evaluated before OR operators. Let's look
# at an example of an ambiguous case. Type: 5 > 8 ## 6 != 8 && 4 > 3.9

5 > 8 ## 6 != 8 && 4 > 3.9


# All that practice is paying off!

#=========================================                              #  58%
# Let's walk through the order of operations in the above case. First the left
# and right operands of the AND operator are evaluated. 6 is not equal 8, 4 is
# greater than 3.9, therefore both operands are TRUE so the resulting expression
# `TRUE && TRUE` evaluates to TRUE. Then the left operand of the OR operator is
# evaluated: 5 is not greater than 8 so the entire expression is reduced to
# FALSE ## TRUE. Since the right operand of this expression is TRUE the entire
# expression evaluates to TRUE.

#===========================================================            #  83%
# The vector `ints` is a random sampling of integers from 1 to 10 without

ints >5

# You are quite good my friend!

#============================================================           #  85%
# We can use the resulting logical vector to ask other questions about ints. The
# which() function takes a logical vector as an argument and returns the indices
